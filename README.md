🎮 Shape-Based Game
📚 Project Overview
The Shape-Based Game is an interactive educational game designed for students from classes 6 to 12 to enhance their understanding of 2D and 3D shapes. The game provides a user-friendly interface where students can explore and interact with different shapes by clicking on them.
🛠️ Technologies Used
•	Java Concepts:
o	Class and Object
o	Constructor and Constructor Overloading
o	Inheritance and Polymorphism
o	Upcasting and Method Overriding
o	HAS-A Relationship and Interface
🚀 Key Features
•	Interactive interface allowing users to click and explore various shapes.
•	Demonstrates object-oriented principles like inheritance, method overriding, and upcasting.
•	Robust and extensible codebase with dynamic shape behaviors.
