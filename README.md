🎮 Shape-Based Game
📚 Project Overview
The Shape-Based Game is an interactive educational game designed for students from classes 6 to 12 to enhance their understanding of 2D and 3D shapes. The game provides a user-friendly interface where students can explore and interact with different shapes by clicking on them.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Java Concepts:

Class and Object

Constructor and Constructor Overloading

Inheritance and Polymorphism

Upcasting and Method Overriding

HAS-A Relationship and Interface

🚀 Key Features
Interactive interface allowing users to click and explore various shapes.

Demonstrates object-oriented principles like inheritance, method overriding, and upcasting.

Robust and extensible codebase with dynamic shape behaviors.
